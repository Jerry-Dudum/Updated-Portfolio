                        Hello, my name is Jerry Dudum but the picture you see is of my dog, Rocky. I put
                        him there because I'm a crazy dog person and I
                        love
                        him so much because he's been with me for most of my life and is a huge part of it. Welcome to
                        my
                        portfolio which you can discover a little bit of background information about myself as well as
                        some web apps and projects I have completed.

                    <p class="bio">
                        Well let's start with a little bit about myself. I decided to attend the UCB Coding Bootcamp
                        because I love technology and problem
                        solving and was
                        seeking to
                        switch career paths because web development and programming is a huge interest of mine. Problem
                        solving
                        is
                        something I always loved to do and it is always present within coding. Also I've been hooked on
                        computers
                        ever since I was 5 years old and have even built over 6 customs gaming PCs for my self and
                        various
                        friends.
                        I decided it was time to take the leap of faith and get out of my comfort zone and this is where
                        my
                        journey
                        begins. Below you can view some of the web apps and projects in my portfolio that I have made as well as links to my
                        Github, LinkedIn, and Email.
