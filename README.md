## Summary

This an updated version of my portfolio. I like to be very minimalistic and with the desgin for now as well as utilizing neutral colors. Definitely in later renditions I will spice it up a bit but for now I like the simplicity and straight forwardness. The new updated portfolio is a single page with all my web apps and project located below. Also my contacts are at the bottom once you finished going through you can access my Github, LinkedIn, and send me an email if you'd like to.
